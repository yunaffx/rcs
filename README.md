My overall PhD research focuses on bee electroreception, a highly niche area of study with limited established methods. This field often requires developing and testing novel methods, as reference papers are scarce. One aspect of my first rotation involves evaluating two potential methods to neutralize an objectâ€™s charge (objects or insects) and bring it as close to zero as possible. 

I am testing two methods to neutralize charge on objects (e.g., insects) to as close to zero as possible. Colleagues suggested a plasma source (lighter) could neutralize charge, but its effectiveness on positively charged bees is unknown.

Using a Faraday Pail (reliable) and a Ring Charge Sensor (RCS) for complementary readings, I conducted two experiments:

Plasma Method: Materials (small/large bumblebees, nylon balls, wax-coated nylon) were positively charged using an ion gun, exposed to the lighter for 1 min, and charge was measured using the pail and RCS.
Control (No Plasma): Same setup as above but without the lighter. Additional trials were done to address grounding issues.
